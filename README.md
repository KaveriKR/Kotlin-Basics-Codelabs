#Kotlin- Learning Codelabs
These codes samples are set of learning tutorials that I had designed and created for learning Kotlin language with code implementations inside Android Studio. These covers the question "How to use Kotlin basis" for a starter and "How does Kotlin simply coding " , these code sample include comments that gives a better understanding of the usage of the Kotlin syntax directly from the Kotlin lang official site.

Reference :- https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/
These codes have been written in Android Studio 3.2 , using the new AndroidX Library in which uses androidx.* package hierarchy and hence different set of dependencies.If you would like to go with the older android.* package hierarchy the following reference can help you in refracting or finding the substitute dependencies.

Reference:- https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/refactor
Although , it is recommended to start using the AndroidX library , as the latest addon's after the 28 support library will be made to this packages. The developer site:- "This is the stable release of Support Library 28.0.0 and is suitable for use in production. This will be the last feature release under the android.support packaging, and developers are encouraged to migrate to AndroidX 1.0.0."
